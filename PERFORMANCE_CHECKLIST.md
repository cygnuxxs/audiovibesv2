## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Targets

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (target: 20-30% improvement)
- **FID/INP**: < 100ms (target: 15-25% improvement)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (target: 40-50% improvement)

### Lighthouse Scores
- **Performance**: 90+ (target: +10-20 points)
- **Best Practices**: 95+

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

1. **Build Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Production Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Lighthouse Audit**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Navigate to Lighthouse tab
   - Run audit in "Navigation" mode
   - Test both mobile and desktop

4. **Test URLs**
   - `/` - Homepage
   - `/?q=telugu+songs` - Search results
   - `/?q=different+query` - Cache testing

5. **Check Core Web Vitals**
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
   - Check Network tab for caching
   - Verify image loading priority
   - Check font loading behavior
